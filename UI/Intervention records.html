<h1>What past storms teach us</h1>
<p>After South Carolina’s historic flooding in October 2015, road and bridge repairs cost $137 million with the state paying about $49 million of that cost, S.C. DOT said at the time.

Some repairs took many months, forcing residents to take alternative routes. For example, one bridge near Columbia that washed out took eight months to rebuild.

And when Hurricane Matthew brought catastrophic flooding to eastern North Carolina in October 2016, hundreds of roads and bridges were damaged. It was more than a year before they were were all fully repaired.

The total repair cost: Almost $200 million. The federal government covered about three quarters of that amount and the state covered the rest.</p>

<h1>Some old bridges at risk</h1>
<p>More than 400 bridges cross North and South Carolina rivers that reached “major” flood levels as a result of the storm, according to an Observer analysis of data from the U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Weather Service.

Those include the the Waccamaw and Pee Dee rivers in South Carolina and Cape Fear, Neuse and Lumber rivers in North Carolina.

Collectively, these bridges carry more than 2.9 million drivers daily, data show.

Brian Hanks, state structures engineer for N.C. DOT, said floods can damage bridges, especially if the structures are already in poor condition.

Rushing water can send debris smashing into pilings or cause bridge decks to separate from their supports.

If water has washed away sediment from beneath bridge piers, or if those piers have deteriorated, bridges can become more vulnerable, Hanks said.

Often, such bridges are old and were not built to current standards, he said.

About 40 bridges along the majorly flooded rivers in the Carolinas have deteriorated piers or sediment that has washed away, data show. Half are at least 60 years old.</p>
